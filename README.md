# Tutorial: Getting Started Developing a Chat app with the Kotlin SDK
> Simple chat app to demonstrate the basic principles of creating a chat app with PubNub.  This app is written in Kotlin, targeting Android and uses the JetPack Compose library for the UI

PubNub allows you to create chat apps from scratch or add them to your existing applications. You can focus on creating the best user experience while PubNub takes care of scalability, reliability, security, and global legislative compliance.

Create 1:1 private chat rooms, group chats, or mega chats for large scale events, for a variety of use cases.

> For the sake of simplicity, this application will only focus on a single 'group chat' room

## Demo

This application is not available on the Play Store but can be built and run locally in an emulator (or multiple emulators to simulate chat between multiple participants)

## Features

- [Publish and Subscibe](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/kotlin/api-reference/publish-and-subscribe) for messages with the PubNub Kotlin SDK
- Use [Presence](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/kotlin/api-reference/presence) APIs to determine who is currently chatting
- The [History](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/kotlin/api-reference/storage-and-playback#history) API will retrieve past messages for users newly joining the chat
- Assign a 'friendly name' to yourself which will be available to others via the PubNjub [Object](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/kotlin/api-reference/objects) storage APIs
